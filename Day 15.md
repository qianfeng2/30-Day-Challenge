## morning 
### upsA project
- 9:40-10:00 review what I did for upsA calculation at global data
- 10:15-11:10 upsA proportion calculation(may need to submit a blastp job) 
- 11:30-12:30 draw the arrow in the manuscript

## afternoon 
### rec det project
- 3:30-4:30 translate the S1 and S2 data
- 4:40-5:30 estimate the viterbi path for S1 data
- 5:40-6:30 estimate the viterbi path for S2 data 



The dream is plump but the reality is skinny.

I finished the 10:15-11:10 task at 5:53 pm. will collect and analyze the ups classification tomorrow morning.

I have done the 3:30-4:30 task two months ago! Good


I realize the the mosaic for S1 and S2 would cost half months again like the pilot data. So I should do it tomorrow morning.
In addition, the recombinants in each country should analyzed separately.
lastly, do the upsA comparisons.
add arrrow.
