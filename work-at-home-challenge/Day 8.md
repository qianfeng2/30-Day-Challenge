Today I had a meeting with my two supervisors. They adviced me to work even I am at home. Though I am not happy, but I agree I should work some time instead of playing all the time.

11：00-12：00  dataset size results analysis.



Task1: I finished the S1 1000 target sequences extraction, tomorrow I should try to get split and estimate the rho from a series of numbers.

- 10:00-11:00 adjust the codes to collect results. collect, s50,s150, t50
