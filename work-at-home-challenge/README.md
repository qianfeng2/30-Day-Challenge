# Work-At-Home-Challenge

In my country, there has been a serious infectous disease called Coronavirus recently. Unfortunately, all travellers from mainland China are denied entry to Australia from 1st Feb to 14th Feb. I will stay at home and work at home. There is a big challenge for me since I have not work at home for a long perios of time, maybe several years.

I start my work from 3rd Feb 2020, will stop until I could get back to Australia.
