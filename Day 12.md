### Manuscript Writing
- add arrows into the network figures; 

Finish at 10:30 am. But I really do not like adding arrows, it makes me crazy. Need too much patience!! 

- rewrite the real data analysis section and 

- finish rewriting the whole simulation results chapter; 

If possible, I will rethink the writing of the method chapter.

Done at 6:46pm. 

I will send these two versions of manuscripts directly to two supervisors at 6th Jan, 2020. 

Zitong told me I should be polote and not send them during the Christmas holiday.
