- [upsA] pipeline 1 to Ghana pilot data do not remove singeltons. 
   The latest result is very close to Shazia's picture.

   However, there is one problem in it. I found there are very rare DBLb, DBLz domains in pilot, S1 and S2. How to claissify them into upBC or upA reasonably?

- [upsA] allocate reads to domain.py try DBLa1.3 sequences.
   test passed! When the input fasta is DBLa1.3 sequences from Rask's paper, it indeed outputs the DBLa1.3 domain correctly. It indicates this allocate_reads_to_domain.py is correct, there is no prolem in it!
