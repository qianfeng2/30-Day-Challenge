## morning

- 9:40-10:40 upsA prportion task 2

- 11:00-12:00 




Today is really a happy day. I do a lot of things! Send the manuscript to supervisors, also send the upsA analysis to them. Great!
Now I will do something else.

Suddenly, I feel I have already done a lot for global data. Except the replication of Gerry's work at my first year of PhD, I not only analysis the upsABC proportions, but also identify the recombinants in each country. There is also highly likely that recombinants happen more frequently in the same ups group(to be verfied), but this has been demonstrated in Ghana pilot data.


# ups A project thoughts:
In the ups project, we face two main problems, one is what the normal soft classification strategy is? another one is how to make full use of Blastp results smartly?

Currently the answer of first question is we normally need to get a lot of predictors for each subject. However, in our project, we only sequences, previous exploration do not allow us to use sequence information to finish classification accurately, that is why we have to use the blastp. In terms of next question, how to give weights to each E value? Currently there is [one way](https://www-sciencedirect-com.ezp.lib.unimelb.edu.au/science/article/pii/S0006291X06027938#bib5) to deal with blastp E value by mutual information. Theyy can convert E values to a vector of MI(A, B), but even though I am given the weights, what should I do next???
