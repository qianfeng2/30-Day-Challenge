## morning

- 9:40-10:40 upsA prportion task 2

- 11:00-12:00 




Today is really a happy day. I do a lot of things! Send the manuscript to supervisors, also send the upsA analysis to them. Great!
Now I will do something else.

Suddenly, I feel I have already done a lot for global data. Except the replication of Gerry's work at my first year of PhD, I not only analysis the upsABC proportions, but also identify the recombinants in each country. There is also highly likely that recombinants happen more frequently in the same ups group(to be verfied), but this has been demonstrated in Ghana pilot data.
